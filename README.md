## The Good , The Bad and the ugly of Flutter-Dart.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Good


Flutter is great for fast paced ui building. It just works and works
great. The trouble one has to go through for animations and building
ui's in Xml in native, comes pre-built in flutter. Also it is cross
platform and works across both android and ios.


## The Bad


Everything in flutter is a plug-in. Plug-ins are pre build libries
written by other developers, which actually convert the written code
in native for both ios and android. One does not have the freedom to
access the underlying native platforms. It has to be done by a plug-in.
But the good news is there are already thousands and thousands of plug-in
available for flutter.The configuration file 'pubspec.yml' is awful to edit.
any wrong intent or spaces cause the whole thing to break.


## The Ugly


Dart is an ugly language. From access modifiers to interfaces to even
naming conventions, its all ugly.
